## Usage

Install `vitest-console` with your favorite package manager:

```shell
$ pnpm add -D vitest-console
```

Add a setup file to your [Vitest configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#configuration) and inline the `vitest-console` module:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    deps: {
      inline: ['vitest-console'],
    },
    setupFiles: ['tests-setup.ts'],
  },
})
```

Extends the built-in Vitest matchers with `vitest-console` in your setup file:

```ts
import { expect } from 'vitest'
import { matchers } from 'vitest-console'

expect.extend(matchers)
```

You can now mock various `console` methods either globally in your setup file, in a test file or even a `describe` block:

```ts
import { afterAll, afterEach } from 'vitest'
import { mockConsole } from 'vitest-console'

const { clearConsole, restoreConsole } = mockConsole()

afterEach(clearConsole)
afterAll(restoreConsole)
```

> **Note**
>
> You can also mock `console` methods in a specific test:
>
> ```ts
> test('should do the thing', () => {
>   const { restoreConsole } = mockConsole()
>
>   doTheThing()
>
>   expect(console).toHaveLogged('The thing was done.')
>
>   restoreConsole()
> })
> ```

## Mock

Mocks are set up using the `mockConsole` function:

```ts
mockConsole(methods?: ConsoleMethods): ConsoleMock
mockConsole(options?: ConsoleMockOptions): ConsoleMock
mockConsole(methods: ConsoleMethods, options: ConsoleMockOptions): ConsoleMock
```

### Parameters

#### `methods`

By default, `console.error`, `console.info`, `console.log` and `console.warn` are mocked but you can specify your own list of methods to mock:

```ts
import { mockConsole } from 'vitest-console'

mockConsole(['log', 'table'])
```

#### `options`

You can silence any console output during tests using the `quiet` option:

```ts
import { mockConsole } from 'vitest-console'

mockConsole({ quiet: true })
```

### Return value

The `mockConsole` function returns an object that contains two functions to clear (reset all informations about every call) and restore (revert the original console method implementations) the `console`:

```ts
import { afterAll, afterEach } from 'vitest'
import { mockConsole } from 'vitest-console'

const { clearConsole, restoreConsole } = mockConsole()

afterEach(clearConsole)
afterAll(restoreConsole)
```

## Matchers

## Vitest matchers

If needed, you can also use the built-in matchers from Vitest with mocks created using `vitest-console`.

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { mockConsole } from 'vitest-console'

test('should test if a message was logged', () => {
  const { restoreConsole } = mockConsole()

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalled()

  restoreConsole()
})
```
